## Briefing Notes

I come from a Drupal front-end development background, with some Laravel and Vue.js experience. I choose the following languages and technologies for this because the JavaScript ecosystem, specifically [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org), is something I have currently have an interest in.

1. Uses [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) as a framework for React.js
2. Styling CSS-in-JS components with [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)
3. Cropped and compressed JPG images and removed cruft code from SVG logo/icons
